8. **"High prevalence of S. aureus in raw and cooked hospital food samples showed insufficiency of cooking time and temperature in the kitchens of hospitals as well as lack of personal hygiene."**  
   → **Claim** (interpretation/conclusion based on findings)

9. **"Further studies are essential to assess other microbiological and epidemiological aspects of the S. aureus."**  
   → **null** (recommendation, not a claim or evidence)

10. **"Practical applications Due to the general weakness of hospitalized patients, hospital food samples should have a high microbial quality."**  
    → **null** (general statement, not directly tied to results)

11. **"Staphylococcus aureus is common foodborne bacteria with an emergence of antibiotic resistance."**  
    → **null** (background information)

12. **"This study emphasizes the importance of multidrug resistant S. aureus in hospital food sample."**  
    → **Claim** (conclusion drawn from the study)

13. **"Results represented that hospital food samples may act as a reservoir of S. aureus with ability to transfer antibiotic resistance."**  
    → **Claim** (summary and interpretation of results)
